We have not used ORM in the project. ORM changes the way we interact with the database. With ORM we no longer write SQL queries for the most part. Instead, We use ORM to interact with the database through entity classes such as Hotel, Booking, User. For example, instead of writing SELECT * FROM Hotels, ORM allow us to use methods such as .ToList() or .Find().
