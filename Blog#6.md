2) give a summary on the final project outcome:
   
the primary goal of our project was to design and implement a hotel booking  management system that supports authentication accsess control, and role based permissions. The system can search, booking and manaing hotel reservations. Through planning, coding and testing we succesfully delivered a solution that met our requirments for the system in the previous phase of the project.

Throughout our work we had some key features and achievements:

a. user booking and authentification
   - Designed an intuitive interface for users to search for destinations, hotels and make reservations seamlessly.
   - implemented a secure login to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
   - made passwords and claims based on identity.
   - Integrated a database to update booking status dynamically.
   - made access control to differentiate access levels between user roles (e.g., Admin, User).


3. learning outcomes
   
This project has significantly improved the booking process for users while providing tools to manage their reservation operations. Beyond delivering the product, this project taught us valuable lessons about balancing user experience with technical efficiency, building web based systems.
The hotel's booking system is a platform designed to bridge the gap between customers and hotels, offering security and growth opportunities for the hospitality industry.

   

4)The group decided to set a clear scope early in the project and defined several user stories to guide development. One user story presented significant challenges:

"As a user, I want to be able to cancel or modify my bookings, so that I can change my hotel booking."

This feature turned out to be too large in scope to implement within the project timeline. The complexity of handling cancellations and modifications exceeded our available resources and time. Despite our best efforts, the group was unable to fully realize this feature within the project constraints. Moving forward, we would prioritize breaking down such large features into smaller, more manageable tasks to ensure feasibility and progress.
